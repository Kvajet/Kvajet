# Hello there ðŸ‘‹, welcome to Kvajet's GitHub!

## Who am I?

My name is Jan TichÃ½ (may be known as Kvajet), I am/was student at CTU, faculty of information technology (ÄŒVUT FIT), depending on time you are reading this sentence.

I am programmer, aren't I? I would say so. I am interested in all kinds of programming languages but my heart fell in love with good old C and good new C++.

## This section exists only because of GitHub recommendation ðŸ¤·

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Game Dev and world of graphics representation!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: you can contact me on: kvajet@gmail.com . 
- ðŸ“š This line is probably greedy but I have some skill in C/C++, JavaScript/TypeScript, Bash and a little bit of LISP/Racket. With some hard feelings I am able to write HTML and CSS code, PHP and some Python scripts.
- ðŸŽ¨ I am able to do some nice bitmap edit (Inkscape, PS), vector graphics (Inkscape) and a bit of pixel art (Aseprite).
