# Hello there ðŸ‘‹, welcome to Kvajet's GitHub!

## Who am I?

My name is Jan TichÃ½ (may be known as Kvajet), I am/was student at CTU, faculty of information technology (ÄŒVUT FIT), depending on time you are reading this sentence.

I am programmer, aren't I? I would say so. I am interested in all kinds of programming languages but my heart fell in love with good old C.
